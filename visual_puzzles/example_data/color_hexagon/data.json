    "explanation": "We observe that a purple part is opposite another purple part, and a red part is opposite another red part. Thus, the pattern is that the colors in opposite parts are the same.",
    "deduction": "Based on the pattern that spatially opposite parts have the same color, the missing color of the part which is opposite a yellow part should be yellow.",

    "prompt": "What is the missing color of the part denoted with a question mark? This part should be completely filled with the correct color while the other parts should be unchanged. The question mark disappears. Then nothing happens and the scene remains static. Do not zoom in or out, or change the positions of the shapes.",
